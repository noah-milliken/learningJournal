                <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over
                    to
                    the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

            <h3>I stay committed to learning</h3>

            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to
                create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>

            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about
                my journey with the world.</p>

            <h3>How I Got started</h3>

            <p> I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to
                create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>

            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my
                journey with the world.</p>

            <p>That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also
                helping
                others learn and stay motivated.</p>
